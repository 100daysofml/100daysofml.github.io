# Week 13: Advanced Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to Week 13 of the 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge! This week marks the beginning of Module 6: Advanced Machine Learning and Current Trends. We'll explore one of the most exciting areas of modern AI - Reinforcement Learning.

## Overview

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, where we have labeled training data, RL agents learn through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for their actions. This week, you'll build a strong foundation in RL concepts and implement basic RL algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning and how it differs from supervised and unsupervised learning
- Define and work with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Implement basic RL algorithms including Q-Learning and SARSA
- Apply value-based and policy-based methods to simple environments
- Understand the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- Build simple RL agents to solve classic control problems
