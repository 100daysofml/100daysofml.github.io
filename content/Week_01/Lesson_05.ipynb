        "A function can contain all the same variable definitions, mathematical operations, conditional statements, and loops that you're already familiar with. The only difference is that code written directly into your Python file or Jupyter notebook cell is executed immediately (\"sequentially\"); code inside a function is merely being defined. It won't execute until the function is called.\n",

        "\n",

Avoid using the same name for local and global variables as it can lead to confusing \"shadowing\" effects, where the local variable \"shadows\" the global variable.

        "Let's introduce NumPy by demonstrating the matrix multiplication required in a linear regression calculation. We'll compute the loss, which is a measure of how far our model's predictions are from the actual outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the step-by-step process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import NumPy Library**\n",
        "   - First, we import NumPy: `import numpy as np`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Define Coefficients and Data**\n",
        "   - Suppose we have a linear model with coefficients `a` and `b` (for a simple linear equation `y = ax + b`). We'll represent these as a NumPy array:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     coefficients = np.array([a, b])\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Let's also define our data points. In a simple linear regression, we often have input (`x`) and output (`y`) pairs. For this example, `x` and `y` are both arrays. Our `x` data needs an additional column of ones to account for the intercept `b`:\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "     y_data = np.array([y1, y2, ..., yn])\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Perform Matrix Multiplication for Prediction**\n",
        "   - We compute the predicted `y` values (`y_pred`) using matrix multiplication between our data (`x_data`) and coefficients. In NumPy, matrix multiplication is done using the `@` operator or `np.dot()` function:\n",

The program should keep track of the number of attempts made by the user and display this number once they have successfully guessed the correct number. Inputs include the user's guesses, and outputs are the feedback messages and the total number of attempts once the game is successfully completed.
