    "-   **Shape Analysis:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   **Symmetry:** Symmetric histograms represent data that are evenly distributed around a central value.\n",
    "    -   **Skewness:** Asymmetry in the histogram (right-skewed or left-skewed) indicates that the data are not evenly distributed. Right-skewed (positive skew) means the tail is longer on the right, left-skewed (negative skew) means the tail is longer on the left.\n",
    "    -   **Modality:** The number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak, bimodal has two, and multimodal has more than two.\n",
    "-   **Bin Width:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The width of the bins can significantly affect the histogram's shape and the insights you can draw from it.\n",
    "    -   **Narrow Bins:** Can make the histogram look more 'spiky' and detailed but can also introduce noise.\n",
    "    -   **Wide Bins:** Tend to smooth out the noise but can hide important details in the data distribution.\n",
    "-   **Frequency vs Density:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   **Frequency Histogram:** The height of each bar shows the number of data points in each bin.\n",
    "    -   **Density Histogram:** The area of each bar represents the proportion of the data that falls into each bin, and the total area of all the bars sums to 1."
