    "## Introduction to Vectors\n",
    "### What is a Vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A vector is an ordered collection of values, often represented as an array or a list. In mathematics and programming, vectors are used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are essential for various tasks in linear algebra, machine learning, and data analysis. A vector may be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  v_1 \\\\\n",
    "  v_2 \\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "  v_n\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where $n$ represents the number of components or elements in the vector.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Vectors in mathematics and physics possess both magnitude and direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnitude:**\n",
    "- Magnitude represents the size or length of a vector.\n",
    "- It is denoted as $||v||$ or $|v|$ for a vector $(v)$.\n",
    "- Magnitude is a non-negative scalar value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Direction:**\n",
    "- Direction indicates where the vector points in space.\n",
    "- It specifies the orientation of the vector relative to a reference frame.\n",
    "- Direction can be represented using angles, unit vectors, or specific directions in a coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To fully describe a vector, both its magnitude and direction are essential.**\n",
    "While vectors have **BOTH** magnitude and direction. (i.e. A car traveling 60kph, NE), a scalar represents **ONLY** magnitude (i.e. distance, speed, measurement)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance:** Vectors are of paramount importance in various scientific and engineering disciplines due to their versatility in representing both magnitude and direction. Just like matrices, vectors find wide-ranging applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In physics: Vectors are fundamental for describing physical quantities such as force, velocity, acceleration, and displacement. They help analyze the motion and interactions of objects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In engineering: Vectors are used to represent the direction of loads, forces, and other structural elements in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In computer science: Vectors are indispensable in data structures and algorithms, particularly in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they are used to represent and process data, such as feature vectors for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are a fundamental concept in mathematics and science, providing a concise and powerful means to represent a wide range of real-world phenomena and mathematical relationships. Understanding vectors is essential for tackling complex problems across various fields.\n"
