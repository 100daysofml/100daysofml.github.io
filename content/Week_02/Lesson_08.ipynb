    "## What are Derivatives?\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives are a fundamental concept in calculus that allow us to understand how a function changes as its input (independent variable) changes. They provide information about the rate of change, slope, and behavior of functions. In this lesson, we'll explore the concept of derivatives, their importance, and how they are used in various fields, including machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Rates of Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are driving a car, and you want to know how fast your speed is changing at a specific moment. This rate of change in speed is precisely what derivatives help us calculate. Whether it's measuring the speed of a car, the growth of a population, or the behavior of a stock price, derivatives are essential for understanding these changes."

    "### Basic Derivative Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore some basic derivative formulas that you'll frequently encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Power Rule:** For a function $(f(x) = x^n$), its derivative is $(f'(x) = n \\cdot x^{(n-1)}$). For example:\n",
    "- If $(f(x) = x^2$), then $(f'(x) = 2 \\cdot x^{(2-1)} = 2x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constant Rule:** The derivative of a constant (a number that doesn't change) is always zero. For example:\n",
    "- If $(f(x) = 5$), then $(f'(x) = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sum and Difference Rules:** The derivative of a sum or difference of two functions is the sum or difference of their derivatives. For example:\n",
    "- If $(f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1$), then $(f'(x) = 4x + 3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Product Rule:** If you have a product of two functions \\(u(x)\\) and \\(v(x)\\), you can find their derivative using the product rule:\n",
    "- $((u(x) \\cdot v(x))' = u'(x) \\cdot v(x) + u(x) \\cdot v'(x)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quotient Rule:** If you have a quotient of two functions \\(u(x)\\) and \\(v(x)\\), you can find their derivative using the quotient rule:\n",
    "- $(\\left(\\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\\right)' = \\frac{u'(x) \\cdot v(x) - u(x) \\cdot v'(x)}{(v(x))^2}$).\n"

    "The Quotient Rule is a fundamental concept in calculus for finding the derivative of a function that is the quotient (division) of two other functions. Mathematically, the Quotient Rule states that if we have two functions $(u(x)$) and $(v(x)$), then the derivative of their quotient $(\\left(\\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\\right)$) is given by:\n",

We want to find the rate at which the car's speed changes concerning time, which is the derivative.\n",
