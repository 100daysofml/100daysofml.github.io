    "  - In engineering: Matrices are employed to describe systems of equations in control theory, electrical circuits, and structural analysis.\n",
    "  \n",

    "   \n",
    "- A matrix of any shape can be multiplied by a **scalar** (i.e. a number describing magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Matrix multiplication, denoted as $(Z = X \\cdot Y$), is an operation between two matrices $(X$) ($(i \\times j$)) and $(Y$) ($(k \\times l$)), where the number of columns in $(X$) is equal to the number of rows in $(Y$). The resulting matrix $(C$) has dimensions ($(m \\times n$)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula:** The element $(Z[i][j]$) of the resulting matrix $(Z$) is obtained by taking the dot product of the $(i$)th row of matrix $(X$) and the $(l$) column of matrix $(Y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$[\n",
    "Z[i][j] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (X[i][k] \\cdot Y[k][j])\n",
    "$]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Rules:**\n",
    "1. **Compatibility:** For matrix multiplication to be defined, the number of columns in $(X$) must be equal to the number of rows in $(Y$) (i.e., the inner dimensions must match).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Associativity:** Matrix multiplication is associative, meaning that $((X \\cdot Y) \\cdot Z = X \\cdot (Y \\cdot Z)$) if the dimensions allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distributivity:** Matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition, i.e., $(X \\cdot (Y + Z) = (X \\cdot Y) + (X \\cdot Z)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Dot Product (Element-wise Product):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The matrix dot product, denoted as $(Z = X \\cdot Y$) (or $(X \\circ Y$)), is an element-wise operation between two matrices $(A$) and $(B$) of the same dimensions. The resulting matrix $(Z$) has the same dimensions as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula:** Each element $(Z[i][j]$) of the resulting matrix $(Z$) is obtained by multiplying the corresponding elements of matrices $(X$) and $(Y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z[i][j] = X[i][j] \\cdot Y[i][j]]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Rule:** Matrix dot product is applied element-wise, meaning that each element of the resulting matrix is calculated independently based on the corresponding elements of the input matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** Matrix dot product is often used in element-wise operations, such as calculating element-wise differences or similarities between matrices. It is commonly used in various mathematical and computational tasks, including image processing and certain types of data transformations."
