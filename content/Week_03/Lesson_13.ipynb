    "Filling Age with Median\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why Use Median for Age**:\n",
    "    -   **Robust to Outliers**: The median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean. In datasets where age might have extreme values or a skewed distribution, using the median ensures that the imputed values are not unduly influenced by these extremes.\n",
    "    -   **Dealing with MCAR or MAR**: If the missingness in the 'Age' column is MCAR (Missing Completely at Random) or MAR (Missing at Random), median imputation provides a reasonable estimate that preserves the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Mode Imputation**:\n",
    "    -   **Use when**: Best for categorical data..\n",
    "```python\n",
    "embarked_mode = titanic_data['Embarked'].mode()[0]\n",
    "titanic_data['Embarked'].fillna(embarked_mode, inplace=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "-   **Why Use Mode for Embarked**:\n",
    "    -   **Categorical Data**: 'Embarked' is a categorical variable (representing different embarkation points). For categorical data, mean and median are not applicable. The mode, which is the most frequently occurring category, is a natural choice for imputation.\n",
    "    -   **Preserving the Most Common Category**: By using the mode, you maintain the original distribution of the data as closely as possible. It ensures that the statistical and structural integrity of the 'Embarked' column is maintained post-imputation.\n",
    "    -   **Handling MCAR/MAR**: If the data is MCAR or MAR, replacing missing values with the most common category (mode) helps to retain the representativeness of the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### General Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **No Distortion of Original Distribution**: The goal is to impute missing values in a way that the overall distribution and relationships in the data remain as unaffected as possible.\n",
    "-   **Contextual Decision Making**: The choice of imputation method should also consider the context and importance of the variable in the dataset. For instance, if a variable like 'Embarked' is crucial for the analysis or model, careful consideration is needed to choose the most appropriate imputation method that reflects the real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the choice of median for 'Age' and mode for 'Embarked' is driven by the nature of these variables (continuous vs. categorical) and the goal of preserving the original data distribution while responsibly handling missing values.    "

    "\n",
    "-   **Mechanism**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation works by finding the 'k' closest neighbors to a data point with missing values and then imputes those values based on the non-missing values of these neighbors.\n",
    "-   **Applicability**: This method is particularly useful when the data exhibits a pattern or relationship, such as in cases where similar observations have similar types of values.\n",
    "-   **Choosing 'k'**: The choice of 'k' (number of neighbors) is crucial. A smaller 'k' might capture more variance in the data, while a larger 'k' can smooth out the noise but might lead to bias.\n",
    "-   **Distance Metric**: KNN uses a distance metric (like Euclidean distance) to find the closest neighbors. The choice of the distance metric can significantly impact the imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for KNN Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Standardize Data**: KNN is sensitive to the scale of data, so it's often recommended to standardize data before using KNN imputation.\n",
    "-   **Handle Outliers**: Outliers can skew the distance metric, leading to inaccurate imputation. Handling outliers before imputation can be beneficial.\n",
    "-   **Consider Computational Cost**: KNN can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets with many missing values."
