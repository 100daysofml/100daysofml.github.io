    "### **Final Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five steps outlined in the lesson plan are generally aligned with best practices in machine learning for data preprocessing, splitting, and model evaluation. However, there are a few additional considerations and potential modifications to ensure efficiency and prevent data leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access and Load the Dataset:** This step is straightforward and essential. Ensure data confidentiality and compliance with data usage policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "        Best Practice: It's crucial to conduct preprocessing on the training set independently from the test set to prevent data leakage. This means normalizing or standardizing the training data and then applying the same transformation to the test data using parameters from the training set.\n",
    "        Modification: Split the data into training and test sets before applying any normalization or encoding to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Splitting the Dataset:**\n",
    "        This step is well-placed after initial data loading and handling missing values but should ideally be done before applying more complex preprocessing steps like normalization and encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training a Model:**\n",
    "        Best Practice: This step is well-positioned after preprocessing and splitting. Ensure that the model is trained only on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation Techniques:**\n",
    "        Best Practice: Evaluating the model on the test set is crucial to assess its performance on unseen data. Using a variety of metrics provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance.\n",
    "        Consideration: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, metrics like ROC-AUC and F1-score are particularly informative.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### **Additional Considerations for Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "        Should ideally be performed before finalizing the model to understand its generalizability. Cross-validation should be conducted on the training dataset only.\n",
    "        For time-series data, use time-series specific cross-validation methods to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection and Engineering:**\n",
    "        Should be done after splitting the data to prevent information from the test set leaking into the model training process.\n",
    "        Any feature engineering should also be consistent across training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Leakage Prevention:**\n",
    "        Be vigilant about not allowing information from the test set to influence the training process.\n",
    "        This includes careful handling of any preprocessing steps like scaling, normalization, or data augmentation."
